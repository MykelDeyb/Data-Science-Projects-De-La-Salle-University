# Data-Science-Projects-De-La-Salle-University
The Data-Science-Projects-De-La-Salle-University repository showcases a collection of data science projects from my studies at De La Salle University, where I integrated economics and data science. The projects highlight my skills in data analysis, visualization, and modeling using Python and R, with a focus on practical applications to real-world economic and business issues.

The repository contains several Jupyter Notebooks, including:
 * **Analyzing Imperial Manila Syndrome in the Philippines.ipynb**, which explores the economic disparities between Metro Manila and other regions in the Philippines using data-driven insights and visualizations.
 * **Career Recommender System.ipynb**, where I implement a recommendation system to assist individuals in finding suitable career paths through machine learning techniques.
 * **DIY Gradient Boosting Algorithm.ipynb**, a hands-on implementation of a custom gradient boosting algorithm to understand its functionality.
 * **Understanding Feature Selection and Data Handling Methods.ipynb**, which demonstrates various feature selection techniques and data preprocessing methods for optimizing machine learning models.
 * **Understanding Model Explainability.ipynb**, where I examine approaches to interpret and explain machine learning model predictions for better decision-making.
 * **CMCI Visualization Project.py**, which visualizes data from the Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index (CMCI) to highlight trends and insights.

The tools and technologies used across these projects include Python and R programming languages, libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn, as well as applications like Jupyter Notebook and various IDEs, such as VS Code.

These projects reflect my academic journey at De La Salle University, where I applied data science concepts to address economic and business challenges. They embody my commitment to using data-driven approaches in solving real-world issues.
